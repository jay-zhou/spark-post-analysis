Ideally, you should limit the places where a variable changes to very specific locations in your code. This is one reason to avoid global variables and static variables unless you have very good reasons to use them. Even then, you should define accessor methods as an interface for these variables rather than changing them directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you debug your code, I suggest you look for ways you can improve it so that debugging isn't so difficult in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1440565" LastActivityDate="2014-09-14T03:07:29.340" CommentCount="0" />
